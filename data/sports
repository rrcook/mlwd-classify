For some American hockey players at the highest level, memories of childhood are filled with idyllic days on frozen ponds and outdoor rinks. But for a growing number, childhood memories are framed by palm trees, warm weather and rooting for N.H.L. teams that many Northerners disdain as a failed Sun Belt experiment. Those memories reflect the

PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. &mdash; Johan Santana has been throwing a baseball for almost two weeks, but the next time he throws a pitch in a major league game could be more than four months from now, perhaps sometime close to the All-Star break.

PHOENIX &mdash; It was Don Mattingly &rsquo;s opening news conference at his first spring training as the Dodgers &rsquo; manager, and a seat at the head of a picnic table was reserved for him.

LOS ANGELES &mdash; So what if the weather on the horizon is as forbidding as the ma&icirc;tre d&rsquo; at Koi glaring at the common people?

Kemba Walker had the ball at about the free-throw line and he was being covered by a player 9 inches taller than him. He had quite a list of possible plays in front of him.

TAMPA, Fla. &mdash; Joba Chamberlain arrived at the most important spring training of his young career listed at 230 pounds , just as he was all last season. This would not be a problem except that Chamberlain weighs more than 230 pounds, and the Yankees are hardly pleased that he does. Asked Wednesday morning for his impression of Chamberlain,
In late 1999, three friends created a Web site to solicit fans to acquire the Jets . The quixotic effort at one point claimed commitments worth $20 million from 11,000 people.

CLEARWATER, Fla. He stood beneath a palm tree on a clear Florida morning, commanding attention as he always has across a lifetime in baseball.

JUPITER, Fla. &mdash; In explaining how the St. Louis Cardinals have reached the end of negotiations to extend the contract of Albert Pujols, the team&rsquo;s owner, Bill DeWitt Jr., really did not have to utter much more than one short declarative sentence. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not the Yankees ,&rdquo; he said after Pujols&rsquo;s self-imposed noon
